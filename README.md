# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection Model

A machine learning-based system for detecting diseases in plant leaves using image classification. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and classify various plant diseases from images, helping farmers and agricultural experts take timely action.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects multiple plant diseases with high accuracy.
- Supports common crops like tomato, potato, corn, etc.
- Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and more.
- Clean and modular code structure for easy customization and extension.
- Streamlit web app for real-time image upload and disease prediction.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of plant leaf images categorized by disease type. The model can distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves across multiple classes.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
